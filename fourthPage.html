  <h2>Flowers</h2>
  <h2>Many genus species of the nightshade family are used for their hallucinogenic properties.</h2>
  <p>Notably, these flowers contain tropane alkaloids like atropine, scopolamine, and hyoscyamine. While these alkaloids can be used in low doses to treat other afflictions. In higher doses, they can cause seizures, hallucinations, delirium, psychosis, and even death. Despite this, there are many who consume these plants for their hallucinogenic effects.</p>
  <p>However, it is important to note that these hallucinations differ from those obtained from psychedelic drugs like LSD and shrooms. Tropane alkaloids work by blocking receptors in the nervous system that regulate memory. This is what causes hallucinations. In contrast, LSD and psilocin (the active compound of shrooms) enhance your body’s senses. <p>Hallucinations caused by deliriants are indistinguishable from reality. Interestingly, these flowers have also been used culturally in witchcraft and shamanic rituals.</p> 
  <p>In my own words, I would describe the difference between psychedelics and deliriants like this:</p> 
  <p>Psychedelics enhance perception of what is already there, while deliriants create things that aren’t there at all.</p>
